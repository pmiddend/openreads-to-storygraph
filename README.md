![Build](https://github.com/pmiddend/openreads-to-storygraph/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)

Convert your [openreads](https://github.com/mateusz-bak/openreads) backup files into files that [The StoryGraph](https://www.thestorygraph.com/) understands so you can import your books.

## Usage

Build it, either with `nix build` or via `cabal` and then run it via:

```
openreads-to-storygraph backup-file > output.csv
```

You can then import the `output.csv` file in StoryGraph and treat it as if it's a Goodreads export.

# Attribution
